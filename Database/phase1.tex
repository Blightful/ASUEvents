\lhead{Team 3 --- Phase 1}
\begin{center}\textbf{\large Project Description}\end{center}
The objective of this database is to make a user interface that has the ability to create, view, and/or update events such as classes, extra-curricular activies, meetings, etc... that take place in Anne Belk Hall. This database's main use will be to provide convenience and accessibility when checking for room and/or computer availability for scheduling events or personal use. Hopefully, with the assitance of the faculty, we will be able to improve or recreate the building map provided online with additional support and features.\\\\
Our project's database will keep a schedule of the events that occur in each room at what day and time. This database will keep track of event managers along with their scheduled events allowing the managers to add, update, and/or delete their events. Managers will be limited to adding events to rooms that they have permission to access through the use of the permissions field. This permissions field will act as a modified version of unix permissions (ex: 777, 775, etc...).\\\\
We wish to create a versatile framework for this database in order to maybe expand this project to other buildings and events. Hopefully we will be able to complete this project and present a superior product to handle event/room scheduling management.

\begin{center}\textbf{\large Project Questions}\end{center}
We will be meeting with Paul Wilson (the administrative assistant for the CS Department) to ask questions about specifications and valued features for our project. We will be meeting him at 3:00 PM on 3-25-2015 in Anne Belk Hall room 312P. Here are a few of the questions we came up with before the meeting.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do you have a pre-existing database we can view and consult?
    \item What sort of specifications do we need to meet to validate this project?
    \item Can we have access to scheduling records for classes and activities?
    \item What features would you appreciate from this database?
    \item Have there been past efforts to create a similar database? If so, what problems occured?
\end{itemize}
